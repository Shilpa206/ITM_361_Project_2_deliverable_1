    <h2>Why We Love Music?</h2>
    <p>Researchers are discovering how music affects the brain, helping us to make sense of its real emotional and social power.</p>
    <p>I still remember when I first heard the song by Vani Jayaram, “Aanathi neeyara” Something about that song—the lyrics, the melody, the unusual 7/4 time signature—gave me chills. Even now, years later, it still can make me cry.</p>
    <h2>Finally</h2>
    <p>“Music has always been a matter of Energy to me, a question of Fuel. Sentimental people call it Inspiration, but what they really mean is Fuel. I have always needed Fuel. I am a serious consumer. On some nights I still believe that a car with the gas needle on empty can run about fifty more miles if you have the right music very loud on the radio.”</p>
